Advent of Code 2023
===================

I've set myself the challenge of writing this in Rust this year. Please forgive any non-idomatic Rust!

If you want to give this a go, make sure that you have the rust toolchain installed first. You should install the 
toolchain using `rustup` from https://rustup.rs/ (or, for more documentation, see https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). 

Once installed, you'll be able to use `cargo` to run the code. By default, this will run all days. To do so, 

```shell
cargo run
```

To run a specific day, use the `--day <n>` flag.

```shell
cargo run -- --day <n>
```

Unit tests can be run using `cargo test`.
